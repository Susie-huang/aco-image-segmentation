# aco-image-segmentation
A Java Program to identify segments on an image using an Ant Colony optimization algorithm. It is a two-phase procedure:

* First, the cerebrum is extrated using also an Ant Colony algorithm., as described here: https://github.com/cptanalatriste/aco-image-thresholding
* Then, a clustering procedure is applied to the cerebrum.
